= Configuring JVM Parameters

You can configure the required JVM parameters such as
the heap size in the `jvm.options` file in the `config/` folder
of your Hazelcast distribution. Use one option per line. You can also
use `#` at the beginning of the line for comments.

For example, to start Hazelcast with a 8GB heap use the following content
in the `jvm.options` file:

[source,plain]
----
# JVM Configuration
-Xmx8G
----

You can also use the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable
for ad-hoc configuration option. For example, to start Hazelcast
with a 8GB heap, you can use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx8G bin/jet-start
----

You can use the `JAVA_OPTS` also to pass additional properties to Hazelcast:

[source,plain]
----
JAVA_OPTS=-Dhazelcast.operation.thread.count=4 bin/jet-start
----
