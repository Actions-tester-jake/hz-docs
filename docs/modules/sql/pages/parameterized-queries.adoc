= Parameterized Queries
:description: A parameterized query is a type of SQL query that requires at least one parameter for execution. These queries are useful for comparing queries against enums or sanitizing user input to mitigate SQL injection attacks.

== Writing Parameterized Queries

Instead of putting data straight into an SQL statement, parameterized queries use the `?` placeholder in your client code.

For example, consider a map called `employees` whose values are `Employee` objects with the following fields.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name
| Type

|`name`
|`String`

|`age`
|`Int`
|===

You can use a parameterized query to find employees who are older than a given integer:

[source,java]
----
int ageToCompare = 30;
sql.execute("SELECT name FROM employees WHERE employees.age > ?", ageToCompare);
----

NOTE: To use parameterized queries to compare one object to another, you must add the object's class to the member. Doing so allows the member to convert the parameter to an instance of the object.
