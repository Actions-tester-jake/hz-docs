= Connectors for Messaging Systems

Messaging systems allow multiple applications to communicate
asynchronously without a direct link between them. These types of
systems are a great fit for a stream processing engine like Hazelcast since
Hazelcast is able to consume messages from these systems and process them in
real time.
