= Troubleshooting Overview
:description: Find advice for troubleshooting issues in your Hazelcast applications or your cluster deployments.

If you run into issues with Hazelcast, take the following initial steps:

- Check your logs for errors that may be related to your issue.
+
Logs are generated for every member in the cluster, so you must either identify the one from which the issue occurred or collect the logs from all members in your cluster.

- If your error is related to data pipelines, see xref:error-handling.adoc[].

- If you're using a client and you think your error is related to an unreachable member, see xref:clients:java.adoc#java-client-failure-detectors[Java Client Failure Detectors].

- If you still can't find a solution to your issue, consider contacting our support team at link:mailto:support@hazelcast.com[support@hazelcast.com].
