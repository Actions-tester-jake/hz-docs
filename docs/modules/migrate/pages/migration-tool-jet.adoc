To upgrade a Jet cluster to Hazelcast and migrate its job snapshots follow these steps:

. Suspend any running jobs.
. Export a snapshot of your jobs.
. Perform a rolling upgrade.
. Resubmit each job on the upgraded cluster and set the xref:pipelines:configuring-jobs.adoc#initialsnapshotname[`initialSnapshotName` option] to the name of the job's exported snapshot.

See the following topics for help completing these steps:
