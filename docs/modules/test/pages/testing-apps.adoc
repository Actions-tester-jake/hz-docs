= Testing Overview

Testing is important to make sure that changes to your code are working as expected. Learn how to test Hazelcast applications before you go into production.

Hazelcast offers the following testing tools:

- xref:testing.adoc[Unit tests]: For testing classes, components or modules used by your software. Unit tests are in general quite cheap to automate and can be run very quickly by a continuous integration server.

- xref:ROOT:simulator.adoc[Simulator]: For testing potential production problems such as real-life failures, network problems, overloaded CPU, and failing members.
