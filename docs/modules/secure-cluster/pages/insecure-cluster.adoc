= What is an Insecure Cluster
[[insecure-cluster]]

A cluster without security may face with:

* unauthorized cluster members joining or accessing it
* unwanted or malicious clients accessing it
* unauthorized use (access or creation) of cluster resources and data tampering by the malicious cluster members and clients.
Hazelcast offers a comprehensive security suite including features such as TLS/SSL,
socket and security interceptors, cluster member security, identity tokens, and
client authorization to overcome the above consequences.
