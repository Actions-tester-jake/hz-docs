= Adding Batching to a Custom Source
:description: To improve the throughput of your custom sources, you can add batching to reads.

== Defining a Source

Here is how you create a source that reads lines of text from a file:

```java
public class Sources {
  public static BatchSource<String> buildLineSource() {
    return SourceBuilder
    .batch("line-source", x ->
      new BufferedReader(new FileReader("lines.txt")))
    .<String>fillBufferFn((in, buf) -> {
      String line = in.readLine();
      if (line != null) {
        buf.add(line);
      } else {
        buf.close();
      }
    })
    .destroyFn(buf -> buf.close())
    .build();
  }
}
```

Now it is ready to be used from the pipeline, just like a built-in
source:

```java
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(Sources.buildLineSource())
 .writeTo(Sinks.logger());
```

== Adding Batching

While this simple source functions correctly, it's not optimal because
it reads just one line and returns. There are some overheads to
repeatedly calling `fillBufferFn` and you can add more than one item to
the buffer:

```java
SourceBuilder
  .batch("line-source",
    x -> new BufferedReader(new FileReader("lines.txt")))
    .<String>fillBufferFn((in, buf) -> {
    for (int i = 0; i < 128; i++) {
      String line = in.readLine();
      if (line == null) {
        buf.close();
        return;
      }
      buf.add(line);
    }
  })
  .destroyFn(buf -> buf.close())
  .build();
```

This code adds 128 lines at a time. In your specific case you should
use the rule of thumb to target about 1 millisecond spent in a single
invocation of `fillBufferFn`.
